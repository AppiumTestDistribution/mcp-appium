- `src/healing/strategies.ts` - Intelligent fallback locator generation
- `src/healing/ai-healer.ts` - Gemini Flash integration for AI-powered suggestions
- `src/healing/element-healer.ts` - Main healing orchestration with exponential backoff

#### Documentation
- `HEALING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive user guide with best practices
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical architecture and implementation details
- `examples/healing-example.md` - Real-world usage scenarios
- Updated `README.md` with healing features section
- Updated `replit.md` with recent changes

#### Dependencies
